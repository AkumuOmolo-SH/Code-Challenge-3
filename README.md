*# Code-Challenge-3*

This repository contains my solutions for Code Challenge 3. The goal of the challenge was to assess our understanding of JavaScript fundamentals such as: 

-DOM Manipulation – Selecting, creating, and updating elements.

-Event Handling – Listening to clicks, form submits, and page load.

-Fetch API & Promises – Making asynchronous GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE requests.

-Dynamic Rendering – Displaying API data in the DOM.

-Functions & Scope – Organizing logic with named functions and block-scoped variables.

-String Interpolation – Using template literals

-Dataset Attributes – Using data-* attributes to track element IDs.

-Page Load Events – Using DOMContentLoaded to safely start logic.

-Conditional Logic – Responding to specific element interactions.

-State Management – Tracking the current post with currentPostId.


The challenge is an opportunity to practice problem-solving using JavaScript.

All final solutions are organized and presented in this GitHub repository as part of the submission.

**# Description**

A simple blog post management application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete blog posts using a local JSON API. 
This project uses a local backend powered by a json-server and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript. The user can:

-View a list of blog posts
-Click to view full post details
-Submit a form to add a new post
-(Advanced) Edit or delete existing posts


**# How to run the solutions**
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

github.com/AkumuOmolo-SH/Code-Challenge-3

2. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
3. Start the Backend (API).
4. Open the Frontend (You can use Live Server in VS Code).
5. The app will open in your browser.
